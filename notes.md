## Terminal Emulators
* `foot`: I used it. Really. I gave it a chance. Why? Because I wanted to get 
smooth scrolling in terminal. But alas, I never got to that point. At the time 
of writing this, `foot` does not support ligatures, which I think is a much 
bigger issue than smooth scrolling. As such, I will *not* be using `foot`.
