This file is just for some notes for myself to keep track of stuff.

## Terminal Emulators

- `foot`: I used it. Really. I gave it a chance. Why? Because I wanted to get smooth scrolling in terminal. But alas, I never got to that point. At the time of writing this, `foot` does not support ligatures, which I think is a much bigger issue than smooth scrolling. As such, I will _not_ be using `foot`.

Okay okay, I plan on implementing support for foot in [Chroma](https://github.com/aryanjassal/chroma). so, I might give it another chance. I will at least install foot to test out Chroma on `foot`, so all is not lost.
